## Maturity Levels

**Note: This page derived off of [FHIR core Maturity Model](http://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#maturity)**

**There are Maturity Levels on artifacts, all the maturity level numbers are expected to be consistent with HL7 definition of [Maturity Levels (aka FMM)](http://build.fhir.org/versions.html#maturity).**

The content of this release has been subject to significant review through **CO BHA** processes and many aspects of it have been implemented and subjected to interoperability testing through Connectathons and early adoption. However, the degree of testing has varied. Some resources have been well tested in a variety of environments. Others have received relatively little real-world exercise. In general, the infrastructure should be considered to be more stable than the resources themselves. In some cases, there are issues on which input is specifically requested during the **Trial Use** period (see the Outstanding Issue List, and known issues will arise after publication (refer to the **CO BHA** Change Request icon tracker for details.) Guidance from early implementation will help address these areas.

All artifacts in this specification are assigned a "Maturity Level" **modeled** after the well-known [Capability Maturity Model Levels](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model). The  **Maturity** level can be used by implementers to judge how advanced - and therefore stable - an artifact is. The following **Maturity** levels are defined:

| Level | **CO BHA** Definition |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0 | Draft: the resource or profile (artifact) has been published on the current build. This level is synonymous with Draft |
| 1 | The artifact produces no warnings during the build process and the responsible team has indicated that they consider the artifact substantially complete and ready for implementation.
| 2 | The artifact has been tested and successfully supports interoperability among at least three independently developed systems leveraging most of the scope (e.g. at least 80% of the core data elements) using semi-realistic data and scenarios based on at least one of the declared scopes of the artifact (e.g. at a connectathon).
| 3 | The artifact has been verified by the work group as meeting the Conformance Resource Quality Guidelines; has been subject to a round of formal balloting; has at least 10 distinct implementer comments recorded in the tracker drawn from at least 3 organizations resulting in at least one substantive change
| 4 | The artifact has been tested across its scope (see below), published in a formal publication (e.g. Trial Implementation), and implemented in multiple prototype projects. As well, the responsible work group agrees the artifact is sufficiently stable to require implementer consultation for subsequent non-backward compatible changes
| 5 | The artifact has been published in two formal publication release cycles at Maturity Level 1+ (i.e. Trial Implementation) and has been implemented in at least 5 independent production systems in more than one country
| Normative | the artifact is now considered stable and will not change

Tested across scope means:

* For each example context, the artifact has either been: reviewed and approved by a domain expert for that scope area, mapped to an existing implemented scope-area-specific standard or tested in an implementation

The Maturity level is strongly related to stability; the higher the maturity level, the more controls are enforced to restrict breaking changes to the resource.
